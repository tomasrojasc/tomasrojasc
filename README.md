# 👋 Tomás here!

Studied Electrical Engineering and Physics — because why choose between one way to die if you can choose two? I like building things that connect **hardware, software, and science**.

🔬 I’ve worked on **graphene sensors**, **fault detection**, and **data analysis** in applied physics labs.  
💻 These days, I help build **software for research labs** at Balthazar and design experiments that mix curiosity with code.

📸 Also into **photography**, and recently **astrophotography**. Fun fact: my LinkedIn banner photo? I stitched it from three pictures using Python.
